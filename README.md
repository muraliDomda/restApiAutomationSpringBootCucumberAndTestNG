ðŸš€ Executing Tests and Generating Reports
To execute the tests and generate reports using Maven, follow these steps:

-Open a command prompt or terminal.
-Navigate to the root directory of the project.
-Run the following command to clean the project and execute the tests:

-mvn clean test


-This command will compile the project, execute the tests, and generate the test reports.
